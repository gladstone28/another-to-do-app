Flexbox: To-Do App
-------------------


In this project, we had to follow step-by-step instructions to fix a to-do web app. 
All of the HTML and most of the CSS were initiaally intact, however, a few Flexbox values were missing.

In order to complete this project, we had to know how to set an element’s Flexbox properties.

It was recommended that we review the Codecademy Flexbox Lesson before beginning.

The website’s existing index.html and style.css files were displayed in the text editor to the right.
